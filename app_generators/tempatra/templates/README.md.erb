## Usage ##

To run your application:

    $ thin start -p 4567 -R config.ru

Then go to http://localhost:4567/ with your browser.

While you develop, continuously compile your Sass stylesheets with Compass (in another terminal):

    $ compass --watch

And of course, use autospec (in yet another terminal):

    $ autospec
