    This is a Sinatra application generated with [Tempatra](http://github.com/olauzon/tempatra). It is intended for designers and developers who are learning to use Sinatra, Haml, Sass, Compass, and jQuery. Tempatra provides a quick & dirty template to make design mock-ups.

    A common workflow is to start by writing Cucumber features that describe the important elements and interactions of the interface.

    Using [Heroku](http://heroku.com) for deployment, you can quickly share a design idea with your clients and colleagues.

    Writing generators with [RubiGen](http://drnic.github.com/rubigen/) is easy.
